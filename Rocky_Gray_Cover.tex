\lettercontent{Dear Hiring Team,}

% The first paragraph of your job application letter should include information on why you are writing. Mention the job you are applying for and where you found the position. If you have a contact at the company, mention the person's name and your connection here.

\lettercontent{I am excited to apply for the Engineering Manager role within Coinbase's Platform Product Group. With over a decade of experience designing and scaling distributed systems and APIs at companies like Reddit, Cash App, Twitter, Capital One, and Storyblocks, I bring the technical depth and leadership experience required to help Coinbase build a trusted, scalable, and compliant foundation for the onchain economy.}

\lettercontent{At Reddit, I currently lead the Ads API Platform and Business Engineering teams. My work includes driving platform reliability, scaling partner integrations, and delivering cross-functional projects such as a rate-limit redesign that aligned 20+ internal teams and external partners, as well as guiding the first MCP server implementation within Ads, which earned company-wide recognition. Before Reddit, I managed the distributed ledger teams at Cash App, ensuring reliable money movement across the ecosystem, and earlier at Twitter, I scaled the Ads API Data Service team from 5 to 15 engineers, driving adoption of architectural patterns that accelerated product experimentation.}

\lettercontent{Throughout my career, I have consistently:}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Built and scaled engineering teams} — promoting engineers into leadership roles and instilling strong system design practices.
    \item \textbf{Delivered distributed platforms at scale} — from Cash App's real-time ledger to Capital One's dual-region Focus platform, where I co-invented multiple patents.
    \item \textbf{Balanced strategic vision with execution} — defining multi-year roadmaps while guiding teams through rapid delivery in high-growth environments.
    \item \textbf{Maintained hands-on technical depth} — contributing to architecture reviews, code discussions, and incident response, ensuring high-quality engineering processes.
\end{itemize}

\lettercontent{What excites me most about Coinbase is the mission to increase economic freedom. My background building financial and API platforms has given me a deep appreciation for the power of reliable, open systems, and I am eager to apply this experience to accelerate adoption of the onchain financial system.

% The next section of your cover letter should describe what you have to offer the company. Make strong connections between your abilities and the requirements listed in the job posting. Mention specifically how your skills and experience match the job. Expand on the information in your resume.
% Try to support each statement you make with a piece of evidence. Use several shorter paragraphs or bullets rather than one large block of text, which can be difficult to read and absorb quickly.
%For example 

% Using the knowledge and skills I have acquired in my <DEGREE PROGRAM> combined with my technical abilities I believe I can provide significant value to <COMPANY> while providing me invaluable experience to <PREPARE FOR OR FURTHER CAREER>.

% Combining these tools with my interests in <FIELD> issues, I hope to help the <DEPARTMENT> answer questions about the <SUBJECT> behind <FIELD> projects.

% Conclude your application letter by thanking the employer for considering you for the position. 

\lettercontent{I would welcome the opportunity to bring my experience building large-scale platforms, mentoring engineering talent, and driving technical excellence to Coinbase’s Platform Product Group. Thank you for your consideration, and I look forward to the possibility of contributing to Coinbase’s ambitious mission.}
