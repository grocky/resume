\lettercontent{Dear Hiring Team,}

% The first paragraph of your job application letter should include information on why you are writing. Mention the job you are applying for and where you found the position. If you have a contact at the company, mention the person's name and your connection here.

\lettercontent{I am excited to apply for the Software Engineer role within Netflix’s Delivery Engineering team. After five years in engineering management roles at Reddit, Cash App, and Twitter, I am intentionally shifting back into a hands-on IC role to focus on building distributed systems and developer platforms directly. My career has been rooted in technical design, coding, and platform reliability, and I am eager to contribute these skills to Netflix’s mission of improving continuous delivery at scale.}

\lettercontent{Throughout my career, I have built systems that balance reliability, velocity, and developer experience. At Reddit, I guided projects like a multi-cluster rate limit redesign and the first MCP server for Ads. At Cash App, I managed and contributed to the distributed ledger that tracks all money movement in real time. Earlier, at Storyblocks, I built ingestion pipelines for video and image content—automating moderation, encoding, storage, and availability—experience that parallels Netflix’s focus on large-scale, reliable pipelines.}

\lettercontent{I believe my background aligns closely with Delivery Engineering’s goals of improving Spinnaker, Managed Delivery, and the broader developer experience. I have consistently worked on platforms where other engineers were the customers, improving CI/CD pipelines, release safety, and developer tooling. This experience positions me well to design, build, and operate systems that empower engineers across Netflix.}

\lettercontent{Key highlights of my experience relevant to this role include:}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Platform mindset} — built APIs, developer tools, and ingestion systems serving engineering organizations.
    \item \textbf{Hands-on technical depth} — coding in Go, Java, Scala, Python, React, and Angular for platform and tooling projects.
    \item \textbf{Developer productivity focus} — improved release pipelines, deployment safety, and system reliability at scale.
    \item \textbf{Content ingestion pipelines} — at Storyblocks, automated ingestion, moderation, and encoding workflows for large-scale media.
\end{itemize}

%\lettercontent{What excites me most about Netflix is the opportunity to apply my background in content ingestion, platform reliability, and distributed systems to a domain that directly touches hundreds of millions of members worldwide. The challenge of replacing manual processes with federated automation resonates deeply with my past work and passion for building systems that empower both creators and consumers.

\lettercontent{I would welcome the opportunity to bring my platform engineering background, technical skills, and passion for developer experience to Netflix Delivery Engineering. Thank you for your consideration.}
   
% The next section of your cover letter should describe what you have to offer the company. Make strong connections between your abilities and the requirements listed in the job posting. Mention specifically how your skills and experience match the job. Expand on the information in your resume.
% Try to support each statement you make with a piece of evidence. Use several shorter paragraphs or bullets rather than one large block of text, which can be difficult to read and absorb quickly.
%For example 

% Using the knowledge and skills I have acquired in my <DEGREE PROGRAM> combined with my technical abilities I believe I can provide significant value to <COMPANY> while providing me invaluable experience to <PREPARE FOR OR FURTHER CAREER>.
% <RELEVANT LIFE STORY/ WORK/ PROJECT >
% In own projects, my coursework, work as a <PREVIOUS JOB TITLE> I have applied knowledge of <SUBJECT MATTER>.
% <LIST OF SMART SOUNDING SKILLS AND TOOLS>.
% Combining these tools with my interests in <FIELD> issues, I hope to help the <DEPARTMENT> answer questions about the <SUBJECT> behind <FIELD> projects.

% Conclude your application letter by thanking the employer for considering you for the position.
