\lettercontent{Dear Hiring Team,}

% The first paragraph of your job application letter should include information on why you are writing. Mention the job you are applying for and where you found the position. If you have a contact at the company, mention the person's name and your connection here.

\lettercontent{I am excited to apply for the Engineering Manager role within Netflix’s Title and Launch Management (TLM) team. With over a decade of experience leading platform and API engineering teams at companies including Reddit, Cash App, Twitter, and Capital One, I bring deep expertise in building distributed systems, scaling platforms, and guiding cross-functional execution. I am motivated by opportunities where technical excellence, cross-team alignment, and customer impact converge—precisely the challenges TLM is solving as it automates large-scale content ingestion and global distribution.}

\lettercontent{At Reddit, I led the Ads API Platform and Business Engineering teams, improving reliability, scaling integrations, and driving projects like the company’s first MCP server implementation, which earned company-wide recognition. At Cash App, I managed teams responsible for the real-time distributed ledger that tracks all financial transactions across the ecosystem, balancing reliability, compliance, and innovation. Earlier at Storyblocks, I designed and led content ingestion pipelines for video and image contributions. This included automating moderation workflows, encoding pipelines for multiple formats, and ensuring secure storage and high availability of creative assets—experience that directly parallels Netflix’s mission of making content ingestion seamless, scalable, and flexible.}

\lettercontent{Throughout my career, I have consistently:}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Delivered scalable ingestion and distribution platforms} — from Storyblocks’ contributor pipelines to Cash App’s distributed ledger and Capital One’s secure document storage platform.
    \item \textbf{Partnered with external and internal stakeholders} — leading API and SLA discussions, aligning system contracts, and balancing partner needs with organizational priorities.
    \item \textbf{Built and scaled inclusive, high-performing teams} — hiring, mentoring, and promoting engineers while fostering accountability and growth.
    \item \textbf{Blended product vision with engineering rigor} — defining long-term strategies while guiding teams through execution in high-growth, high-stakes environments.
\end{itemize}

\lettercontent{What excites me most about Netflix is the opportunity to apply my background in content ingestion, platform reliability, and distributed systems to a domain that directly touches hundreds of millions of members worldwide. The challenge of replacing manual processes with federated automation resonates deeply with my past work and passion for building systems that empower both creators and consumers.
}

\lettercontent{I would welcome the opportunity to contribute my expertise in content ingestion pipelines, distributed platforms, and engineering leadership to Netflix’s TLM team. Thank you for your consideration, and I look forward to the possibility of helping shape the future of content delivery at Netflix.}
   
% The next section of your cover letter should describe what you have to offer the company. Make strong connections between your abilities and the requirements listed in the job posting. Mention specifically how your skills and experience match the job. Expand on the information in your resume.
% Try to support each statement you make with a piece of evidence. Use several shorter paragraphs or bullets rather than one large block of text, which can be difficult to read and absorb quickly.
%For example 

% Using the knowledge and skills I have acquired in my <DEGREE PROGRAM> combined with my technical abilities I believe I can provide significant value to <COMPANY> while providing me invaluable experience to <PREPARE FOR OR FURTHER CAREER>.
% <RELEVANT LIFE STORY/ WORK/ PROJECT >
% In own projects, my coursework, work as a <PREVIOUS JOB TITLE> I have applied knowledge of <SUBJECT MATTER>.
% <LIST OF SMART SOUNDING SKILLS AND TOOLS>.
% Combining these tools with my interests in <FIELD> issues, I hope to help the <DEPARTMENT> answer questions about the <SUBJECT> behind <FIELD> projects.

% Conclude your application letter by thanking the employer for considering you for the position.
