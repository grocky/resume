\lettercontent{Dear Hiring Team,}

% The first paragraph of your job application letter should include information on why you are writing. Mention the job you are applying for and where you found the position. If you have a contact at the company, mention the person's name and your connection here.

\lettercontent{I am excited to apply for the Engineering Manager role for Poe's Platform team. With over 12 years in software engineering and 5+ years in engineering leadership, I bring deep technical expertise in platform engineering combined with a passion for AI-driven developer productivity. My career has been focused on building foundational systems that empower engineering organizations—from developer tooling and CI/CD pipelines to distributed platforms serving internal and external customers.}

\lettercontent{Throughout my career, I have built platforms where engineers are the customers. At Reddit, I designed and led implementation of the first MCP server and RAG architecture for the Ads API platform, earning top recognition at the company-wide hackathon. I also drove developer velocity improvements by reducing build times, optimizing Kubernetes deployment orchestration, and advocating for smaller, safer changes. At Twitter, I led the development of contract-based testing for our public Ads API, which guarded against breaking changes from upstream teams and significantly increased confidence in platform evolution. Earlier at Capital One, I managed a dual-region Kubernetes platform serving 100+ internal applications at 1K TPS peak, while spearheading Terraform adoption and leading the infrastructure-as-code community of practice.}

\lettercontent{I am particularly drawn to this role because it aligns my extensive platform engineering experience with my growing passion for AI. I have been diving deeper into AI capabilities and am eager to leverage the latest AI tools to enhance team productivity—an area where I already have hands-on experience. The opportunity to work on Poe's platform team, building the foundation that enables rapid integration of cutting-edge AI models, is exactly where I want to focus my technical leadership.}

\lettercontent{Key highlights of my experience relevant to this role include:}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{AI \& Developer Productivity} — designed MCP server and RAG systems, built AI tooling for local development, established myself as MCP subject matter expert.
    \item \textbf{CI/CD \& Testing Frameworks} — reduced deployment times through Kubernetes optimization, built contract-based testing to prevent breaking changes, created developer tools that increased team velocity.
    \item \textbf{Infrastructure at Scale} — managed dual-region Kubernetes clusters, led IaC adoption with Terraform, built platforms serving 100+ applications.
    \item \textbf{Technical Leadership} — scaled teams from 5 to 15 engineers, promoted multiple ICs to Staff and EM, mentored engineers across multiple organizations.
    \item \textbf{Python \& JavaScript} — built microservices in Node.js, developed vector databases in Python, full-stack experience across multiple languages and frameworks.
\end{itemize}

\lettercontent{I would welcome the opportunity to bring my platform engineering expertise, AI experience, and passion for developer productivity to Poe. Thank you for your consideration.}
   
% The next section of your cover letter should describe what you have to offer the company. Make strong connections between your abilities and the requirements listed in the job posting. Mention specifically how your skills and experience match the job. Expand on the information in your resume.
% Try to support each statement you make with a piece of evidence. Use several shorter paragraphs or bullets rather than one large block of text, which can be difficult to read and absorb quickly.
%For example 

% Using the knowledge and skills I have acquired in my <DEGREE PROGRAM> combined with my technical abilities I believe I can provide significant value to <COMPANY> while providing me invaluable experience to <PREPARE FOR OR FURTHER CAREER>.
% <RELEVANT LIFE STORY/ WORK/ PROJECT >
% In own projects, my coursework, work as a <PREVIOUS JOB TITLE> I have applied knowledge of <SUBJECT MATTER>.
% <LIST OF SMART SOUNDING SKILLS AND TOOLS>.
% Combining these tools with my interests in <FIELD> issues, I hope to help the <DEPARTMENT> answer questions about the <SUBJECT> behind <FIELD> projects.

% Conclude your application letter by thanking the employer for considering you for the position.
