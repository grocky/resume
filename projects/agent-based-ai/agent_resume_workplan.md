# Agent-Based Resume Framework Work Plan

## Project Overview
Create an intelligent system that automatically generates job-specific resumes by analyzing job descriptions and tailoring static background data to highlight the most relevant experience and skills.

## Quick Start for AI Agent
This work plan is designed for an AI coding agent (like Claude Code) to implement systematically. Each phase includes specific deliverables, file structures, and validation criteria. Follow phases sequentially, as later phases build upon earlier infrastructure.

## Phase 1: Foundation Setup (Days 1-3)

### 1.1 Repository Structure Creation
- Initialize git repository with proper `.gitignore`
- Create complete directory structure:
  ```
  resume-agent/
  ├─ meta/
  ├─ data/
  ├─ template/
  ├─ tools/
  ├─ jobs/
  └─ .github/workflows/
  ```
- Set up base `Makefile` with core targets (`new`, `gen`, `build`, `clean`)

### 1.2 LaTeX Infrastructure
- Implement custom `resume.cls` LaTeX class with professional formatting
- Create `resume_template.tex` with Jinja2 templating support
- Test LaTeX compilation pipeline with sample data
- Ensure proper handling of special characters and formatting

### 1.3 Data Schema Design
- Define YAML schemas for:
  - `background.yaml` (roles, personal info, themes)
  - `achievements.yaml` (quantified accomplishments by company)
  - `skills.yaml` (categorized technical and soft skills)
  - `prompt_vars.yaml` (job-specific variables)

## Phase 2: Core Tools Development (Days 4-7)

### 2.1 Generation Engine (`tools/generate.py`)
- Build Jinja2-based template renderer
- Implement YAML data loading and validation
- Create basic resume assembly logic
- Add error handling and logging
- Support for dynamic content selection based on job requirements

### 2.2 Compilation Pipeline (`tools/compile.py`)
- LaTeX compilation with `latexmk` integration
- PDF generation and output management
- Compilation error handling and reporting
- Cleanup of intermediate LaTeX files

### 2.3 Meta-Prompt System
- Design comprehensive meta-prompt for AI agent interaction
- Include job description analysis instructions
- Define achievement selection and tailoring guidelines
- Specify LaTeX output requirements and validation rules

## Phase 3: Intelligence Layer (Days 8-12)

### 3.1 Job Description Analysis
- Implement NLP-based keyword extraction
- Identify must-have vs nice-to-have requirements
- Create relevance scoring for achievements and skills
- Build requirement categorization (technical, leadership, domain-specific)

### 3.2 Content Optimization Engine
- Algorithm for selecting most relevant achievements
- Dynamic bullet point generation and tailoring
- Keyword optimization while maintaining authenticity
- Achievement quantification and impact highlighting

### 3.3 AI Agent Integration
- Design prompts for different resume sections
- Implement context-aware content generation
- Build feedback loop for continuous improvement
- Create validation system for generated content

## Phase 4: Automation & Workflow (Days 13-16)

### 4.1 Make Targets Implementation
- `make new JOB=<path>`: Create new job folder structure
- `make gen JOB=<path>`: Generate LaTeX from data and job description
- `make build JOB=<path>`: Compile PDF from LaTeX
- `make clean`: Remove temporary files

### 4.2 CI/CD Pipeline
- GitHub Actions workflow for automated building
- PDF artifact generation and storage
- Multi-job parallel processing
- Quality checks and validation

### 4.3 Quality Assurance Tools (`tools/lint.py`)
- LaTeX syntax validation
- Content quality checks (length, formatting)
- ATS-friendly formatting verification
- Consistency checks across resume versions

## Phase 5: Advanced Features (Days 17-20)

### 5.1 Multi-Format Support
- HTML resume generation for online portfolios
- Plain text version for ATS systems
- JSON structured data for API integration
- Word document export capability

### 5.2 Analytics & Optimization
- Track which achievements perform best for different job types
- A/B testing framework for resume variations
- Success metrics integration (application responses, interviews)
- Data-driven improvement recommendations

### 5.3 Template Customization
- Multiple resume template options
- Industry-specific formatting
- Company culture adaptation
- Personal branding consistency

## Phase 6: Testing & Documentation (Days 21-23)

### 6.1 Comprehensive Testing
- Unit tests for all Python tools
- Integration tests for full pipeline
- LaTeX compilation testing across environments
- Edge case handling (missing data, malformed inputs)

### 6.2 Documentation Suite
- Complete README with usage examples
- API documentation for all tools
- Troubleshooting guide
- Best practices for data maintenance

### 6.3 Example Content Creation
- Sample background, achievements, and skills data
- Multiple example job descriptions and generated resumes
- Tutorial walkthrough for new users
- Video demonstrations of key workflows

## Phase 7: Deployment & Maintenance (Days 24-25)

### 7.1 Production Setup
- Docker containerization for consistent environments
- Environment-specific configuration
- Backup and version control strategies
- Security considerations for personal data

### 7.2 User Onboarding
- Setup scripts for new users
- Data migration tools from existing resumes
- Configuration templates
- Validation tools for initial data setup

## Success Metrics

- **Generation Speed**: <30 seconds from job description to PDF
- **Relevance Score**: >85% keyword alignment with job requirements
- **Quality Consistency**: Zero LaTeX compilation errors
- **Customization Depth**: 3-5 tailored achievements per role
- **Format Compliance**: ATS-friendly formatting maintained

## Risk Mitigation

- **LaTeX Dependencies**: Include fallback compilation methods
- **AI Hallucinations**: Implement strict validation for generated content
- **Data Privacy**: Local-only processing, no external API dependencies
- **Template Maintenance**: Version control for template changes

## Deliverables

1. Complete working framework with all tools
2. Comprehensive documentation and examples
3. CI/CD pipeline for automated processing
4. Test suite with >90% coverage
5. User guide and best practices documentation

## Technology Stack

- **Languages**: Python 3.8+, LaTeX, YAML, Jinja2
- **Tools**: Make, latexmk, git
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
- **Optional**: Docker for containerization

## Implementation Notes for AI Agents

### Code Quality Standards
- Include comprehensive error handling and logging
- Write docstrings for all functions
- Use type hints where appropriate
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Include unit tests for each component

### File Naming Conventions
- Use underscores for Python files: `generate_resume.py`
- Use hyphens for directories: `job-configs/`
- Use ISO date format for job folders: `YYYY-MM-DD_company_role`

### Validation Requirements
- Validate YAML schemas on load
- Check LaTeX syntax before compilation
- Verify file permissions and dependencies
- Test with sample data after each phase

### Testing Strategy
- Create test fixtures for each data type
- Mock external dependencies (LaTeX compiler)
- Test edge cases (missing files, malformed data)
- Verify PDF output quality and formatting

This work plan provides a structured approach to building a robust, intelligent resume generation system that can adapt to different job requirements while maintaining professional quality and consistency.
